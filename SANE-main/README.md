# SANE-search-to-aggregate-neighborhood-for-gnn

### Overview
This is the code for our paper [Search to aggregate neighborhood for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06608), publised in ICDE 2021.
It is a differentiable architecture search for graph neural network (GNN).

### Requirementsï¼š
torch-cluster==1.5.7  
torch-geometric==1.6.3  
torch-scatter==2.0.6  
torch==1.6.0  
scikit-learn==0.21.3  
numpy==1.17.2  
hyperopt==0.2.5  
python==3.7.4

### Instructions to run the experiment
**Step 1.** Run the search process, given different random seeds.
(The Cora dataset is used as an example)
```
python train_search.py  --data Cora --fix_last True  --epochs 20
```
The results are saved in the directory `exp_res`, e.g., `exp_res/cora.txt`.

**Step 2.** Fine tune the searched architectures. You need specify the arch_filename with the resulting filename from Step 1.
```
python fine_tune.py --data Cora  --fix_last True   --hyper_epoch 50  --arch_filename exp_res/cora.txt   
```
Step 2 is a coarse-graind tuning process, and the results are saved in a picklefile in the directory `tuned_res`.
